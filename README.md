Current hardware target: **KMMX Controller V4**. V2 remains in the project as older supported hardware.

## 🌟 Features

- **Animated LED Matrix Displays** for eyes and mouth expressions
- **Real-time facial animations** including blinking, emoting, and mouth movements
- **Audio-reactive visemes** that respond to speech
- **Proximity sensing** for interactive "booping" responses
- **Accelerometer integration** for motion-based animations and responses
- **Bluetooth connectivity** for remote control and configuration
- **Customizable expressions** using bitmap assets

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **⚠️ Advanced Users Only:** This setup assumes familiarity with ESP32 development, PlatformIO, and embedded systems. The configuration is specific to my custom hardware, so expect to need significant modifications for your own build.

### Prerequisites

**Required:**

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) IDE or PlatformIO Core
- KMMX Controller V2/V4 custom ESP32-S3 board, or an ESP32-S3 board with matching pin/config changes
- Basic understanding of C/C++ and embedded development
- Soldering skills for hardware assembly

**Common Hardware Components:**

- HUB75 LED Matrix panels (64x32 resolution recommended)
- APDS9930 or VL6180X proximity sensor (optional, for booping feature)
- LIS3DH (V2) or MPU6050 (V4) accelerometer/IMU (optional, for motion detection)
- I2S microphone module (optional, for viseme/audio reactivity)
- WS2812/SK6812 LED strips (optional, for cheek/status LEDs)
- SSD1306 OLED display (optional, for HUD)
- PWM fan (optional)
- Appropriate power supply (5V, sufficient current for LED panels)

## ⚙️ Configuration

> **Note:** Configuration is currently scattered across multiple files and tailored to my specific hardware. Expect to dig through the source code to customize for your setup.

Key configuration areas you'll need to review:

- **Pin assignments** for all hardware components
- **LED matrix settings** (resolution, brightness, color correction)
- **Animation timing** parameters and frame rates
- **Sensor thresholds** (proximity, accelerometer sensitivity)
- **Bluetooth/BLE** device name and service UUIDs
- **Feature flags** to enable/disable specific hardware modules

Look for configuration in:

- Board pin definitions in `boards/`
- Main hardware settings in `src/config.h`
- Individual device driver files in `src/Devices/`
- BLE GATT service and characteristics in [`BLE_INTERFACE.md`](BLE_INTERFACE.md)
- Generated bitmap headers in `src/Bitmaps/`; the bitmap generation tool is private and not included in this repository.

## 🎮 Web Control Panel
